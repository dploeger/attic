I What is SpamCruncher??

SpamCruncher is a small Perl-Script, that uses the
SpamAssassin-engine to identify spam on remote POP3-
or IMAP-Servers. So you only need SpamCruncher if your
E-Mail host doesn't offer you free anti-spam services.

II How do I use SpamCruncher??

If you want to use the mail-feature you have to set three options in the spamcruncher-file. Please open it using your favourite 
editor and go to the following line:
# default-values

You can set these options:

$mail_from="spamcruncher <spamcruncher\@mynet.net>";    (FROM-Mailadress for the report-mails)
$mail_subject="SpamCruncher found spam.";	 	(Subject for the report-mails)
$mail_server="smtp.mynet.net";				(SMTP-Server for sending report-mails)

Just start spamcruncher and it will give you usage informations:

Valid actions:
	-c, --check		: Check Spam on server and report, but do nothing
	-d, --delete		: Check Spam on server and report, delete spam messages
	-s, --save		: Check Spam on server and report, save spam messages to spam-folder (see below), then delete on server
	-h, --save-headers	: Check Spam on server and report, save headers of spam-messages to spam-folder, then delete on server
	-e, --move-mail		: (IMAP-only) Move mail to given mail-folder

	-p, --pop3		: Server is a pop3-Server
	-i, --imap		: Server is an imap-Server
	-f, --spam-folder=	: Set spam-folder (local)
	-o, --omit-password	: Password is omitted, ask me, when needing it.
	-P, --port=		: Use port instead of standard POP3/IMAP-Port
	-v, --verbose		: Be verbose doing things
	-a, --scan-folders=	: Give a comma-seperated-list of IMAP-folders to scan. (if ommited, only "INBOX" will be scanned)
	-m, --mailto=		: Send mail report, if Spam was found to given email-adress 
	-l, --mail-folder=	: Set spam-folder for moving IMAP-mail to.

--/snip/--

Generally you have to set one action and one option. 

Examples:

1) You want to check, if there's spam on your remote POP3-Server:

spamcruncher -cpv pop3.mynet.net foobar foobar

=> Checks (-c) and outputs (-v) spam on a pop3-Server (-p) named pop3.mynet.net for the user foobar identifying with the password foobar.

2) You want to move all spam-mails on your remote IMAP-Server to a spam-folder:

spamcruncher -eiv -l INBOX.Spam imap.mynet.net foobar foobar

=> Moves all spam-mails (-e) on the imap-Server (-i) imap.mynet.net to the folder INBOX.Spam (-l) for the user foobar/password foobar.
   A detailed output of the operation is given (-v).

3) Same as 2, but you're using it as a cronjob and want to be notified of the actions through mail.

spamcruncher -ei -l INBOX.Spam -m foobar@mynet.net imap.mynet.net foobar foobar

=> Same as 2), but there's no output to the shell, but a report-mail is sent to foobar@mynet.net

NOTE: ALWAYS USE -C FIRST, SO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY LOOSE MESSAGES YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOSE!!!

III How does SpamCruncher identify spam??

SpamCruncher uses the well-known SpamAssassin Spam-detection-engine for Spamdetection. Everything you need to know is on
www.spamassassin.org.

IV SpamCruncher identifies a message as spam, but it ain't!!

Please go to spamassasin.org for further information. Generally spamassasin uses configuration files where you can set the
spam-identifying options. These are typically at ~/.spamassasin and /etc.
