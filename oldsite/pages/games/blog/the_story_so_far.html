Adventure gaming is the ultimate creative experience there is.
</p>

<p>
That said, some people have problems creating adventure games. Like me. Though there is enough material cramping up my drawers, enough ideas filling up my mind, I simply cannot go through the whole process to be able to finally put the pen, the mouse, the keyboard and everything down and say: “Eureka”.
</p>

<p>
A few weeks ago I had a simple, yet innovative idea. I&#039;m going to free exactly one hour a week of my time to do something for my game. I don&#039;t know, if that&#039;s the final answer to my creative problem, but it&#039;s a good start after all.
</p>

<p>
So this blog I&#039;m using to document my progress every week. Perhaps it&#039;s something, other developers can use to point them in their own direction while drawing, developing, writing, composing, whatever.
</p>

<p>
Okay. Ready? Go.
</p>

<p>
As said, a few weeks ago I started to develop my game every once in a week, exactly one hour long. I light up a candle, tune in into my favourite type of music, relax and put my fingers on the keys. I even turn out phones and other stuff, that could hinder my work.
</p>

<p>
The first thing, I looked into was creating the main character. Although I should add, that I had my little design document already nearly done. (You can have a little look at it <a href="http://dieploegers.de/storyboard/doku.php?id=gamedevelopment:redemption:start" class="urlextern" title="http://dieploegers.de/storyboard/doku.php?id=gamedevelopment:redemption:start"  rel="nofollow">here</a>)
</p>

<p>
So, back to the main character. I had an idea about the overall graphic design, about a serious game with cartoon characters. I always liked cartoons, that have a mean and serious background and a dense atmosphere, but were drawn in a overall cartoonic style. So I drew my main character that way. Let&#039;s meet “Charlie”:

</p>

<p>
After I had the first sketch done, I used a technique, I&#039;ve saw somewhere on the net, namely drawing him from the front and the side. Here are the scans:

</p>

</p>

<p>
Now the ugly part: Animating. I <strong>hate</strong> animating, especially when it&#039;s about walkcycles. So I needed help with that. I first tried a neat little program, an AGS community member developed. It&#039;s ssh&#039;s <a href="http://new.bigbluecup.com/yabb/index.php?topic=26501.0" class="urlextern" title="http://new.bigbluecup.com/yabb/index.php?topic=26501.0"  rel="nofollow">Walkcycle generator</a>.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, ssh only made it to animate low-res graphics and I wanted Charlie to walk in hi-res. (Well, hi-res… I thought about a 640&times;480-resolution)
</p>

<p>
So. What to do? After that I tried my thing in 3d. I&#039;ve seen a web tutorial on how to model characters in a 3d render environment and used this skills (sorry, I cannot describe them here in detail) to build up Charlie as a 3d model. From there it would have been easy to animate him using Inverse Kinematics. I used <a href="http://www.blender3d.org" class="urlextern" title="http://www.blender3d.org"  rel="nofollow">Blender</a> for that.
</p>

<p>
But after building the raw model, I lost the will to carry on in 3d. I realized, that I couldn&#039;t render Charlie so that he would look like a 2d cartoon character and not like a badly rendered 3d-to-cartoon-style graphic. So I quit blender.
</p>

<p>
After that I thought: Hey, can&#039;t I use a 2D program, that knows bones and can rotate and scale images in a way the walkcycle generator did?
</p>

<p>
I nearly wasted Google for that. After a loooong search I finally found, that <a href="http://www.creatoon.com/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.creatoon.com/"  rel="nofollow">CreaToon</a> was released as freeware, because the developer discontinued development.
</p>

<p>
After some experiments with CreaToon I finally got my first walkcycle for Charlie… whiiiich needs a lot of improvement and arms and hands, I know.
</p>

</p>

<p>
That&#039;s where I am at this point. Where this goes? Well, I hope to a game in the end. We&#039;ll see…
