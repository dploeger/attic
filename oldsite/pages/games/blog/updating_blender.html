<div class="level1">

<p>

I&#039;ve updated my blender installation to the all-new 2.43, that includes the famous “sculpt mode” where you can use brushes to modify your meshes. I&#039;d recommend everyone to try out that features, it&#039;s way cool!
</p>

<p>
That said, I tried to remodel Charlie&#039;s head, which really didn&#039;t work out. I couldn&#039;t model it to look like– eh, anything actually. Perhaps I&#039;ll try again next time, because I&#039;m still not convinced with his head.
</p>

<p>
I&#039;m currently playing ”<a href="http://www.runaway-game.de" class="urlextern" title="http://www.runaway-game.de"  rel="nofollow">Runaway 2</a>” where they modeled 3D characters and put them in good 2 1/2-D manner into the game in some cool cel-shading look. They are brilliantly modeled and I think, I wanted Charlie to look a bit like them…
</p>

<p>
Well, perhaps next time. Using blender (and especially new features) takes quite a time to get accompained with.
