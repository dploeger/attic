After last week&#039;s been busy and I couldn&#039;t take my regular time-out for my game, I&#039;ve switched back to Blender today. During the last week I thought about the whole Creatoon thing with flat 2d-images, animated using cut-out-animation, I was afraid of a “South Park”-type of animation. And I think, I couldn&#039;t get Creatoon to neatly display the pictures without wrong pixels and anti-aliasing. So I switched back to Blender and tried the 3d way again and I think, that it worked.
</p>

<p>
My workflow was modeling the character after the front- and side-scan (I probably will post a tutorial about creating your characters using that method), UV-mapped the character using the coloured front- and sideimages (I had to create a “back”-image for that, too) and rigged it using Blender&#039;s armature system.
</p>

<p>
This procedure really takes some time. I think you need about three hours from scanning the image to a good quality model. But the plus is, that you can do what you want with this model. You can animate walkcycles, grabsequences, talking and idle views and so on- and that in every of the standard 8 directions just by moving the camera. So animating the character&#039;s a buzz after this time.
</p>

<p>
I still have some concerns in the UV-mapping, but I&#039;ve quickly wrapped up a small (and ugly) walkcycle for you to demonstrate the new model:

</p>

<p>
Next week I&#039;ll have to optimize the textures and really design the walkcycle. I hope it works and I can present you a complete walkcycle and Charlie&#039;s final birth.
