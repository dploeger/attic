<p>

Today I worked out a quite good walkcycle. After that I wanted to ramp up the complete animation in 8 different views (that&#039;s the best  and most realistic method for a character walkcycle!), but I got lost in locking the camera on a path around my character, so that I only could set 8 different viewpoints and loop the animation.
</p>

<p>
The complete walkcycle takes up 16 frames. That&#039;s way too much for an ordinary character animation in AGS (it makes the game slower!). So I have to find a way to delete every second frame, because 8 frames should be good for the animation.
</p>

<p>
I will post the complete walkcycle here when I&#039;m ready.
</p>

<p>
I&#039;ve also got work to do in modelling and UV-texturing. I need to fine-model the character and after that make the UV-texturing better quality.
</p>

<p>
I&#039;ll post my works here.
