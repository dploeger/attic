This week I didn&#039;t take my hour out for my game. On one hand I had no time this tuesday as something private was taking my time that day but on the other hand I was deeply disappointed with Charlie&#039;s face and my tries to remodel it last week.
</p>

<p>
<strong>But</strong> I&#039;ve surfed the web and the wonderful <a href="http://www.blenderartists.org" class="urlextern" title="http://www.blenderartists.org"  rel="nofollow">http://www.blenderartists.org</a>-Forum to update my modeling techniques and found some nice tips.
</p>

<p>
One nice way to create a head was to just use a simple cube, subdivide it three times (thus giving it more vertices) and cut out the faces where the eye holes and the mouth should be. After that, add a subsurf modifier (that way, the sharp edges are more bezier-type, so the box looks a lot more round) and deform the face using blender&#039;s lattice-objects to get a nice face.
</p>

<p>
I&#039;ve played around with it for some time and can present you my very first face using that method:

</p>

<p>
Err.. Well, I know it&#039;s far from being cool and all, but it&#039;s a start. I also played around with some nice eye tutorial, that basically consists of three balls, two cut in half and rotated to get the eyelids. Very simple, really. Like I said, if I can get myself to model a nice game character, I might make a tutorial out of it.
</p>

<p>
So I&#039;ll try to remodel Charlie&#039;s head next time using the methods I found. Perhaps I&#039;ll find some other methods, that make my modelling life easier.
</p>

<p>
Stay tuned.
