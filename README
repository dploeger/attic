This is my attic.

I've set up this repository to clean up my old projects and still make them available, because I strangely found out, that they were actually downloaded from their old locations...

What's in here?

  * oldsite - an offline dump of my old development site. There you can find some documentations for cets and mailwalk
  * cets - a (very) small one-page-wiki system
  * mailwalk - a small perl system utility for waltzing through your mailserver and doing things
  * lppdf - A pdf implementation for lpd
  * spamcruncher - spamassassin on remote pop3/imap-servers
  * updatemirror - A very small script to mirror websites using wget more easily

There is, however, no support for anything in this attic. If you like, you can grab a project and bring the spark of life back into it. If you do so, please drop me a note, so that I can link to the new project and remove the old things from my attic.
