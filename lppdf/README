Project lpPDF

Author(s): Dennis Plöger (dploeger@web.de)

Usage
-----

lpPDF is a utility to bind a PDF-Conversion into the running printing system by adding an LPD-Printer and using the "Output Filter" lppdf

Configuration
-------------

To use lpPDF on your system, you have to embed it in your running printing system. Add the following lines to your /etc/printcap:

lppdf|pdf distiller:\
        :sd=/var/spool/lpd/lppdf:\
        :mx#0:\
        :lp=/dev/null:\
        :of=/var/spool/lpd/lppdf/lppdf:\
        :sb:

Then create the required directory-structure for lppdf:

mkdir /var/spool/lpd/lppdf
chown lp:lp /var/spool/lpd/lppdf

..copy the lppdf-Script to the specified location and make it executable:

cp lppdf /var/spool/lpd/lppdf
chmod +x /var/spool/lpd/lppdf/lppdf

, see the script for configuration and...

Last, restart the lpd!

/etc/init.d/lpd restart

(For SuSE-Systems before 7.1, use /sbin/init.d/lpd restart)

Now you can print directly to the printer lppdf using lpr -P lppdf <filename>. The output will be done in the configured (see the script!) directory using a unique name of the user and the printing date.

.. have a lot of fun.

This is the first version, a lot of testing has to be done. Besides this:

- Graphical input of filename (inputboxes)
- Tests running lpPDF on centralised printservers.
- Tests on that servers with graphical inputs.
- Tests of possible windows printing (Generic printers? PS-printers??)
- Some other features...
